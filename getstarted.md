- Upload a CSV file that includes these ***exact*** column names among other columns
    - **`Time Stamp`**
    - **`Voltage`**
    - **`Current`**
    - **`Temperature`**
    - **`Capacity`**

    
- For best results, values are expected in Voltage(V), Current(A), Temperature(ÂºC) and Capacity (Ah).

- The 'Capacity' column is optional and only used to compare Predicted SOC with True SOC. 
    
- Once pre-processing is complete, prediction is run using the selected SOC model.

- Upload a different CSV file, choose another example file or select a different SOC model.
